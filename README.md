# FreeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains my completed projects from multiple **FreeCodeCamp** certifications, covering **SQL**, **Bash scripting**, **Python data analysis**, and **scientific computing**.  
It demonstrates my ability to work across different domains â€” from database design and automation to statistical analysis, data visualisation, and algorithmic problem-solving.

---

## Certifications Covered
- **Relational Databases (SQL + Bash)**
- **Data Analysis with Python**
- **Scientific Computing with Python**

---

## Project Highlights

### **SQL & Bash**
- **Objective:** Develop relational database queries and shell scripts for automation.
- **Approach:**  
  - Wrote SQL queries for projects like *Periodic Table*, *World Cup*, and *Student Records*.
  - Created Bash scripts to create, populate, and query PostgreSQL databases.
- **Outcome:** Improved proficiency in SQL joins, aggregate functions, and automated database workflows.

### **Data Analysis with Python**
- **Objective:** Apply Python data analysis techniques to real-world datasets.
- **Approach:**  
  - Cleaned and transformed datasets using **Pandas**.
  - Visualised trends with **Matplotlib**.
  - Built analysis pipelines for:
    - *Sea Level Predictor*
    - *Demographic Data Analyzer*
    - *Medical Examination Analysis*
    - *Time Series Visualisation*
- **Outcome:** Produced clean, reproducible scripts and clear visualisations for statistical insights.

### **Scientific Computing with Python**
- **Objective:** Strengthen Python programming skills through algorithmic and applied computing tasks.
- **Approach:**  
  - Developed tools like a **Sudoku Resolver**, **Probability Calculator**, **Budget App**, and **Polygon Area Calculator**.
  - Implemented algorithms for equation solving, card number verification, and shortest path calculations.
- **Outcome:** Enhanced problem-solving ability and ability to write modular, reusable Python code.
